\subsection{Research Problem}
\begin{frame}{Research Problem}
  Use force and flow sensing to improve performance of UAVs flight control systems.\\
  \pause
  To achieve this we aim to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<3-> Develop distributed force and flow a sensing system for a small scale fixed wing UAV
    \item<4-> Integrate force and flow sensing into conventional flight control system architecture
    \item<5-> Measure response of systems to controlled and natural turbulence
    \item<6-> Develop advanced reflexive flight control system
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}{The hypothesis (or prediction)}
  %What do you think will happen?
  %
  %Fit strain \& differential pressure sensors
  %Carry out WT experiments
  %Carry out outdoors experiments
  %
  %\begin{itemize}
    %\item AoA, Windspeed aero loads compuation/prediction/estimation
    %\item Characterisation of pressure, strain \& force signals as function of ${\alpha}$, V
      %\& ${\delta_{ail}}$
    %\item Acquisition of training/testing daat sets for ANN for ${\alpha}$, V \&
      %${\delta_{ail}}$ prediction
    %\item Identification of stall characteristic markers in pressure \& strain signals, e.g.
      %frequency, variance
    %\item Acquisition of pressure \& strain characteristic response to change in ${q}$
    %\item Explore pressure \& strain response to conditions similar to perching manoeuvre\
    %\item Emulation of pressure \& strain response to gusts

    %\item Vibration of wing has been observed during and after stall. How does this affect
      %pressure \& strain signals?
