\subsection{Research Problem}
\begin{frame}{Research Problem}
  Use force and flow sensing to improve performance of UAVs flight control systems.\\
  \pause
  To achieve this:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<3-> Develop distributed force and flow sensing system for a small scale fixed wing UAV
    \item<4-> Integrate force and flow sensing into conventional flight control system architecture
    \item<5-> Measure response of systems to controlled and natural turbulence
    \item<6-> Develop advanced reflexive flight control system
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

	\item<2->Wind tunnel experiments using WT model
	\item<3->Outdoors experiments using flying platform
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
      \begin{itemize}
	\item<4->[-]Build and instrument a WT model with a distributed array of pressure and strain sensors
	\item<4->[-]Carry out calibration \& characterisation (WT, indoor and outdoor)
	\item<4->[-]Design and implement closed loop control algorithms that use information from distributed array
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The hypothesis (or prediction)}
  What do you think will happen?
  
  Fit strain \& differential pressure sensors
  Carry out WT experiments
  Carry out outdoors experiments
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item AoA, Windspeed aero loads compuation/prediction/estimation
    \item Characterisation of pressure, strain \& force signals as function of ${\alpha}$, V
      \& ${\delta_{ail}}$
    \item Acquisition of training/testing daat sets for ANN for ${\alpha}$, V \&
      ${\delta_{ail}}$ prediction
    \item Identification of stall characteristic markers in pressure \& strain signals, e.g.
      frequency, variance
    \item Acquisition of pressure \& strain characteristic response to change in ${q}$
    \item Explore pressure \& strain response to conditions similar to perching manoeuvre\
    \item Emulation of pressure \& strain response to gusts
    \item Identify pressure \& strain response to varying ${q}$, i.e. ${\dot{q}}$
    \item Vibration of wing has been observed during and after stall. How does this affect
      pressure \& strain signals?
    \item Identify pressure \& strain response to varying ${\delta_{ail}}$, i.e.
      ${\dot{\delta}_{ail}}$
